    <h1 id="skills">Skills</h1>
    <p>
      Over the years I have grown very comfortable around technology. I've spent
      countless hours getting the knowledge to troubleshoot and fix issues with
      my own, and my friends computers. With that came communication skills and
      knowing what to ask to get the most valuable information possible for
      troubleshooting. I also enjoy working on the hardware side of computers as
      well. such as: cable managment, hardware upgrades / replacments, and
      custom built PC's (mods to PC case and internals are my favorite!).

    <h1 id="interests">Interests</h1>
    <p>
      My interests are all over the place. Some would say I have way too many
      hobbies! I've always been interested in technology. It's facinating to me
      how far we've come with it. The speed that technology grows and evolves is
      amazing to me. This facination is what led to me wanting to learn how to
      write code. I like the idea of things changing and having to learn knew
      skills.

    <h1 id="goals">Career Goals</h1>
    <p>
      My career goals would be getting a position in web development. I would
      like to be surround by people that know more than me and have more
      expeirence than I have. That way I am always being motivated and pushed to
      learn more and keep up with those around me. I would like to be able to
      learn and grow with a company, in hopes of that leading to me being a
      valuable asset to the company.
